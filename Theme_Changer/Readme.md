# JAVASCRIPT_PROJECTS

-> THEME CHANGER
      
  In this project you will get feature to change your theme by just click on a single button.   
      It will automatically detect your mode whether it was dark or light.
      
     
  If your mode is Dark then after clicking on button it will change your theme Dark to Light and vice-verse.
